This is a code repository for the project: "7 Modes"

The file "EmpiricalResults.R" performs our main calculation and visualisation. It returns the results for all the populations analyzed. It requires the user's credentials to access the life tables from the Human mortality database (https://www.mortality.org). The Index.html presents all the 7 Modes comparisons for all populations with sufficiently long data to have cohort modes: "https://vcr1972.github.io/7Modes/Index"
